positive assertions:
assert_equal()
assert_true
assert_in
assert_element_present
asser_element_visible
assert_attribute

diff  bw assert_element_visible and assert_element_present
visible will check the visibility of the element on the page
present will check if the element is present in the DOM

assert_in to test the partial text
assert_attribute

# negative assertions:
assert_not_equal()
assert_false

page object model is a design pattern that is used to separate selectors and test scripts,
and also it improves code reusability and maintainability.
